### Questions to Asma:
  - Do we need baskets on user side? (multiple suppliers problems) -> *YES*
  - Do we separate the apps => user/supplier :  -> *NO*
  - At signup, only require documents from wholsellers? -> *YES*
  - How to display Qoffas user-side? -> *NO*
 
   -On supplier signup : choose je suis un commerçant / particulier -> choose catégory
    -Particulier : cp pièce d'identité + catégorie
    -Commerçant : copie du RC

    User-created basket -> linked to ONE supplier
    Supplier-created basket -> normal/surprise (generic icon for both)
    
NEW LOGIC:


One supplier per order.
products from he same supplier are grouped together.
change order structure.
Add basket order.
